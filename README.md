# Web Dev I Final Project

This is my About Me page, a whole semester in the making. It offers many nice features, including the following:
1. Support for user perference of dark or light theme, currently only available in Safari on the latest Mac OS.
2. A gallery of three images, with captions for each.
3. A small excerpt from a popular story.
4. Responsive web design with media queries based around mobile and tablet browsing.
5. A short video to demonstrate the object-fit and object-position properties of CSS.
6. A bootstrap version provided in the bootsrap branch.
